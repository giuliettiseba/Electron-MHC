SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The Get-VmsCameraReport cmdlet provides an extensive number of columns of
    data for each camera. While we try to provide a descriptive column name, the
    meaning of values are not always clear. And sometimes values might not be
    what you expect to see. This topic serves to document some of this
    information to answer questions that may come up when this command is used
    in production.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The columns from IsStarted to StatusTime come from the
    RecorderStatusService2 interface using the GetCurrentDeviceStatus method.
    These values can only be provided if your PowerShell session is able to
    establish a connection to the Recording Server on port 7563 (default).
    The Model and Firmware columns may not perfectly reflect the current model
    and firmware but they should hopefully accurately match what is displayed in
    the Management Client. The firmware is specially troublesome as the value is
    only updated when performing a "Replace Hardware" on the camera in
    Management Client. There is currently no mechanism to perform Replace
    Hardware using MIP SDK or MilestonePSTools.
    The Configured
    vs Current
    stream information will
    usually
    match, but sometimes the stream configuration properties aren't available -
    such as on the universal camera driver. And sometimes even if both the
    configured, and current stream properties are available, they might not
    match. That would be out of the ordinary, but it has happened. For example,
    if a camera is being used by two different VMS's, one may update the stream
    properties to be out of sync with the other.
    The Snapshot feature can be very useful, but you cannot export a jpeg
    snapshot to a CSV file in a way that is universally understood by all
    applications. You could, for example, base64 encode the image and include it
    in text format. But to display the image, the consuming application would
    need to know what to do with that encoded binary data. We will provide an
    example of how you might process the snapshot column in a future sample.
